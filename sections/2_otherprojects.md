                    <h5><i>Semiautomatic generation of semantic building models from image series. </i></h5>
                    <p>Sage-sb is an <i>"... approach to generate a 3D model of a building including semantic annotations from image series. ... This approach has been implemented as a plugin for the photostitching tool Hugin. ... The resulting model contains semantic, geometric and appearance information and is represented in City Geography Markup Language (CityGML)."</i> - project description on sourceforge.net</p>
                    <p> Sage-sb is written in C++ using wxWidgets as the GUI part with an embedded 3D-View which was done in OpenGL.</p>
                    <p>I worked on this project during my work at AGAS. My main area was building the GUI and I was involved in planning the project. For more information have a look at the project and code at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sagesb/" target="_blank">sourceforge.net</a>.</p>

                    <p>Robot Face is a talking head that can talk with synchronized mouthmovements and display its spoken text. It is also able to show emotions. In further development it was also able to show an image or a videostream instead of its face. </p>
                   	<p>I developed it for the robot Lisa of AGAS at the University of Koblenz during my Bachelor thesis. We released a package for the robot operating system (ROS). More details are <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/robot_face">here</a>. </p>
                   	<p>It was written in C++ with <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/">Ogre3D</a> embedded in a Qt application. The face itself was modeled in <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>. <a href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/">Festival</a> was used for the text-to-speech part. </p>
                   	<p>If you are intersted in robot Lisa you can find more information on the <a href="http://userpages.uni-koblenz.de/~robbie/homer/">official website</a>.</p>
