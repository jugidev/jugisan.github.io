                    <p>Semiautomatic generation of semantic building models from image series. </p>
                    <p>Sage-sb is an <i>"... approach to generate a 3D model of a building including semantic annotations from image series. ... This approach has been implemented as a plugin for the photostitching tool Hugin. ... The resulting model contains semantic, geometric and appearance information and is represented in City Geography Markup Language (CityGML)."</i> - project description on sourceforge.net</p>
                    <p>I worked on this project during my work at AGAS. My main area was building the GUI. For more information have a look at the project and code at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sagesb/" target="_blank">sourceforge.net</a>.</p>
